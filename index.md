Hi! I'm Dan Tran and I'm currently a software engineer at Microsoft.
I recieved my Masters Degree at the University of Washington,
majoring in Computer Science.

At Microsoft, I am a part of the team that works on Azure Boost and
I develop and maintain the automated security infrastructure that
allows the team to detect, triage, patch, and track vulnerabilities
within our SLAs. I also oversee the security effort and process for
Azure Boost. My interest is in machine learning and using those
models to better improve our processes and tooling.

You may wish to see my resume available [here](assets/dan_tran_resume.pdf).

**Note**: This website is currently in a very incomplete stage.
More content will come in the near future.

## Internships

### ViaSat

I had the amazing opportunity to intern at ViaSat and modernized
their email application that communicated over low bandwidth
radio frequencies. The application was horribly outdated and
recieved complaints from customers, but I revamped the GUI,
optimized existing functionality and code, and fixed driver related
bugs, improving support for FTP and POP3. Because of this, the
rennovated application meets the customers' criteria and is pleasing
and easy to use.

### Amazon Web Services

I had the amazing opportunity to intern at Amazon Web Services and
worked on the Elastic Beastalk Dataplane Team which deals with the
platforms offered. I expanded an internal platform service used to
keep track of platform information to include additional metadata
about the platform's installed software to fully describe a platform
and fixed their tracker that tracks information about the packages
used in the platforms. I also improved the documentation workflow
by automating the generation of said documentation.
