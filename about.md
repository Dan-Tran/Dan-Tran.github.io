I am currently a software engineer at Microsoft.
At Microsoft, I am a part of the team that works on Azure Boost and
I develop and maintain the automated security infrastructure that
allows the team to detect, triage, patch, and track vulnerabilities
within our SLAs. I also oversee and lead the rotation and process
to resolve vulenrabilities and developed the procedure for our team.

I was a student at at the University of Washington majoring in Computer
Science. Specifically, I am enrolled in their Combined BS/MS Program,
an accelerated program in which I recieved my Masters' degree
in the Spring of 2019. As a student I have taken numerous courses
on a broad range of topics in computer science and have developed
some programs as side projects as well.

My main interests in computer science are machine learning and data
science, but I am also knowledable in other domains like databases,
security, networks, and programming languages. I am to contribute to
the field of machine learning and hope to make meaningful contributions
to the development of machine learning mechanisms like neural networks,
transformer models, and more. I mainly program in Java, SQL, Python,
and C, though I have also experimented with Rust.

Aside from computer science, I also play the clarinet. I currently
play for the Bellevue Community Band and used to play for UW's
Symphonic Band. I was also a member of the ASUW Student Senate, being
the former chair on the Committee on Academic and Administrative
Affairs.
